## Helloo, I am Angella 👋

✨ Welcome to my profile!
I'm an MBA graduate specializing in IT Management & HR, with hands-on experience in business operations, healthcare data analysis, and process optimization. Through my roles at Levich, I’ve strengthened my skills in improving operational efficiency, validating high-volume datasets, and supporting strategic decision-making across teams.

I believe every data set has a story, and I love discovering the patterns, insights, and opportunities hidden within, stories that can reveal inefficiencies, spark innovation, or unlock new potential. Whether I’m building dashboards, validating datasets, or optimizing workflows, my goal is always to empower teams with information that truly makes a difference. 

Curious by nature and driven by impact, I’m always excited to collaborate, learn, and contribute to purposeful, insight-driven work. Let’s create something meaningful together. 🌟
